# Clap Voting

## What is clap voting?

Sometimes things just call for a vote (like deciding if you should dip strawberries in melted chocolate, or just use a knife to smear pasta nusa on them). 

This is where clap voting comes in.

## How does it work?

1. A member of the group calls for a clap vote (the vote caller is known as the clap-master) 
2. All group members gather in a circle
3. The clap master announces all the possible options
4. All group members close their eyes
5. The clap master announces an option
6. Every group member who agrees with the option, calps once
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until there are no more options
8. The option that made the most noise wins!

## What are the benefits?

1. All votes are anonymous
2. It's fun!
